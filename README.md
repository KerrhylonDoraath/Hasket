# Hasket Development

Hasket is a python based program that is designed to create a light shell for streamlined writing of Haskell code.

Refactoring in progress, converting the entire program to object-oriented paradigm. Editor moved across, but I must engage pack forgetting. Follow up to correct the file menus to fix up hasket.

Now, I will add an entry bar to the bottom of the terminal widget to input into there without disturbing the OUTPUT.

Refactoring still in progress, as mostly I could not be asked to fix this. The refactor is still in progress but now I must streamline location of ghci in my program. One option is I send out ghci with my code but that is a bad idea. The other option is.... I get the user to locate ghci themselves. Presumably they'd already have it if they want to develop in Haskell!
